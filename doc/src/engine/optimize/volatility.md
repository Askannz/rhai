Volatility Considerations for Full Optimization Level
===================================================

{{#include ../../links.md}}

Even if a custom function does not mutate state nor cause side-effects, it may still be _volatile_,
i.e. it _depends_ on the external environment and is not _pure_.

A perfect example is a function that gets the current time &ndash; obviously each run will return a different value!

The optimizer, when using [`OptimizationLevel::Full`], will _merrily assume_ that all functions are _pure_,
so when it finds constant arguments (or none) it eagerly executes the function call and replaces it with the result.

This causes the script to behave differently from the intended semantics.

Therefore, **avoid using [`OptimizationLevel::Full`]** if non-_pure_ custom types and/or functions are involved.

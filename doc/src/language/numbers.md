Numbers

{{#include ../links.md}}

Integer numbers follow C-style format with support for decimal, binary ('`0b`'), octal ('`0o`') and hex ('`0x`') notations.

The default system integer type (also aliased to `INT`) is `i64`. It can be turned into `i32` via the [`only_i32`] feature.

Floating-point numbers are also supported if not disabled with [`no_float`]. The default system floating-point type is `i64`
(also aliased to `FLOAT`). It can be turned into `f32` via the [`f32_float`] feature.

'`_`' separators can be added freely and are ignored within a number &ndash; except at the very beginning or right after
a decimal point ('`.`').

| Format                | Type             |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| `123_345`, `-42`      | `INT` in decimal |
| `0o07_76`             | `INT` in octal   |
| `0xabcd_ef`           | `INT` in hex     |
| `0b0101_1001`         | `INT` in binary  |
| `123_456.789`, `-42.` | `FLOAT`          |

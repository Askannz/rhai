# Rhai - embedded scripting for Rust

Rhai is a simple embedded scripting language for Rust that doesn't use any additional dependencies, unsafe code, or a set of APIs outside of what you provide in your program.  This allows you to have rich control over the functionality exposed to the scripting context.

Currently, it's pre-0.1, and is likely to change a bit before it stabilizes enough for a crates.io release.
